# Effect.ts Library Best Practices

**Before implementing Effect features**, run `bunx effect-solutions list` and read the relevant guide.

Topics include: services and layers, data modeling, error handling, configuration, testing, HTTP clients, CLIs, observability, and project structure.

**Effect Source Code Reference:** `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect`

Search the real source code to figure out how the library works. Use an Explore subagent for this. Never look into `node_modules`, look at the real source code instead.

## Effect Atom (effect-atom) library

Prefer reading the existing doc first at 'docs/effect-atom-guide.md'. If you need further investigation the source code is at `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect-atom`.
